📄 AI Developer Interview Prep: Structured Plan for Product Companies
SECTION 1: Core AI/ML Project (End-to-End)
🔹 Project Name

AI Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher

🔹 Purpose

Users upload resumes

Extract skills & experiences

Match resumes to jobs using AI

Recommend improvements

🔹 Tech Stack
Layer	Tools / Libraries
Data Processing	Python, pandas, NumPy
NLP	spaCy, NLTK, Transformers
ML Model	scikit-learn (Optional: XGBoost/RandomForest)
Backend API	FastAPI / Flask
Frontend	Streamlit / React
Deployment	Render / HuggingFace Spaces / Docker
🔹 DSA Concepts Embedded
Concept	Usage in Project	Interview Angle
Arrays / Lists	Store resumes, tokens	Time/space complexity
Strings	Text preprocessing	NLP efficiency
HashMap	Skill → Frequency, Resume → Skills	O(1) lookup
Set	Unique skills, intersection	Duplicate removal
Sorting	Rank resumes/jobs	O(n log n) complexity
Heap / Priority Queue	Top-K matches	Efficient ranking
Sliding Window	N-gram extraction	Text feature engineering
Two Pointers	Compare sorted skill lists	Efficient matching
BFS / DFS (optional)	Skill dependency graph	Graph traversal
Time Complexity	All functions	Explain optimizations
🔹 Step-by-Step Build

Collect resumes + job descriptions

Preprocess text: lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenize

Extract skills using NLP

Store skills in dictionaries/sets

Compute similarity between resume & job using TF-IDF or embeddings

Sort / rank resumes/jobs

Fetch top-K matches using heap

Build API (FastAPI)

Create simple UI (Streamlit)

Deploy and write README

🔹 Interview Explanation Phrases

“I used hash maps for O(1) skill lookup”

“I applied sorting and heaps to rank candidates efficiently”

“Sliding window was used for n-gram generation”

“Time complexity optimizations reduced API response from O(n²) → O(n log n)”

SECTION 2: DSA Practice (Pattern-Based)

Focus: 30–40 must-do problems to be interview-ready for product companies.

🔹 Arrays / Strings

Reverse an array / string

Subarray sum / prefix sum

Sliding window max / min

Two pointers: sorted array intersection, pair sum

🔹 HashMap / Set

Count frequency

Top-K frequent elements

Detect duplicates / intersection

🔹 Sorting / Heap

Sort and rank candidates

Merge K sorted lists

Priority queue: top-K matching problem

🔹 Graphs (Optional)

BFS / DFS traversal

Skill graph traversal (related skills)

🔹 Time & Space Complexity

Must explain for every solution

Example: “My top-K heap is O(n log k) time, O(k) space”

SECTION 3: Interview Prep + Resume Ready
🔹 ML / AI Concepts

Feature engineering (text → TF-IDF / embeddings)

Model selection: RandomForest, Logistic Regression

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision/Recall

NLP preprocessing pipelines

🔹 Questions You Must Be Ready For

How does your project work end-to-end?

How did you optimize your code?

How did you rank resumes/jobs efficiently?

Explain similarity metrics for resume-job matching

Which ML/NLP algorithms did you use and why?

How did you handle large datasets / scalability?

Where did you use DSA in your project? (HashMap, Heap, Sorting, etc.)

How would you improve this system if deployed at scale?

🔹 Resume Bullets (AI/DSA Combined)

Developed an end-to-end AI Resume Analyzer using Python and NLP, processing thousands of resumes with top-K matching optimization

Implemented hash maps, heaps, and sorting algorithms to achieve O(n log k) efficiency in candidate-job matching

Deployed a FastAPI + Streamlit solution for real-time resume evaluation and skill gap analysis

SECTION 4: Suggested 60-Day Plan
Week	Focus
1–2	Build Project (data + preprocessing)
3–4	Implement AI/ML logic + similarity scores
5	Embed DSA (HashMap, Heap, Sorting) + optimize
6	Build API + UI + deploy
7	DSA focused practice (Arrays, Strings, HashMap, Heap, Sliding window, Two pointers)
8	Mock interviews + explain project + ML concepts
9–10	Revise DSA + refine project, resume bullets, answer tricky ML questions

✅ With this structured plan, you will:

Have 1 strong project to explain every DSA concept naturally

Be ready for ML/NLP questions

Be confident in off-campus product company interviews

If you want, I can make a ready-to-use “Project + DSA Cheat Sheet”:

Exact functions + code snippets

DSA explanation templates for interviews

Resume-ready one-liners

This way you can answer any question in 30 seconds confidently.

Do you want me to make that cheat sheet next?
