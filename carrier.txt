🔹 Your current situation
3.2 years .NET experience (software engineering)
Salary: 4.2 LPA
Weak backend fundamentals (EF Core, Docker, APIs)


Goal: AI Developer, remote, 8–10 LPA
You’re willing to “sacrifice experience” if needed
🔹 Your options
Option 1 — Stay in .NET / Backend
Upgrade skills (EF Core, ASP.NET Core, Docker, Cloud)
Salary jump: 7–9 LPA
Later add AI (applied AI on top of .NET)
Safe, stable path, gradual transition
Takes ~6–9 months to reach AI developer role
Pros: Salary security, smooth growth, your experience counts
Cons: Slower pivot to AI, you’re “stuck in backend” until AI skills mature

Option 2 — Switch to pure ML / Deep Learning
Learn Andrew Ng ML/DL, PyTorch, fast.ai
Build ML/DL models, learn math
Goal: Research / ML Engineer / Vision / NLP / RL
Timeline: 6–12 months
Salary (entry-level AI): 3–6 LPA (India)
Pros: True ML knowledge, academic path, can do research later
Cons: You lose your 3.2 yrs experience, lower pay initially, slower to land jobs

Option 3 — Applied AI / Generative AI (Recommended)
Build real apps using OpenAI / Azure AI / Claude
Focus on applied AI (chatbots, RAG, document Q&A, AI automation)
Portfolio = “1 year experience in AI”
Timeline: 3–6 months
Salary: 8–10 LPA (remote startups or product companies)
Pros: Fastest path to AI developer, high salary, leverages some of your software skills, remote possible
Cons: You’re “jumping domains”, but portfolio proves you’re capable
🔹 My recommendation for you specifically


Go for Option 3: Applied AI / Generative AI.
Reasons:
It matches your salary goal (8–10 LPA).
You don’t care about losing old experience, so you can pivot fully.
The market actively hires applied AI developers, even mid-level.
You don’t need deep ML research / DL math → faster transition.
Remote work is realistic with applied AI skills.

🔹 The Clear Next Step
Learn OpenAI / Azure AI / LLM APIs
Build 3 portfolio projects: Chatbot, RAG with documents, AI automation
Deploy online (Azure free tier / Render / GitHub)
Create a resume as AI Developer
Apply for remote AI developer roles, 8–10 LPA
If you want, I can make a week-by-week 6-month roadmap that will take you from zero AI to ready-to-hire AI developer for remote roles at 8–10 LPA.
