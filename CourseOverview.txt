Step 1: Learn the Foundation (Need to finish january month )

    Before jumping to AI-specific courses, you need a strong base in Python and math.

    🔹 What to learn:
        Python Programming (basics + libraries for AI like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
        Math for AI:
        Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
        Probability & statistics
        Basic calculus (derivatives for optimization)
        Basic programming logic & data structures
    🔹 Recommended beginner-friendly resources:
        Free: Python for Everybody – Coursera
        Free: Khan Academy – Linear Algebra & Probability
        Free: fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders
        – after Python basics
    ⚡ Goal: You should be comfortable with Python and understand math concepts used in AI.

Step 2: Learn Core AI & Machine Learning (2–3 months)

Once you have the foundation, start AI-specific concepts:

🔹 What to learn:

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: Linear regression, decision trees, clustering

Neural networks basics

Data preprocessing and visualization

Projects: Build simple models (predict prices, classify images)

🔹 Recommended structured courses:

Free beginner-friendly: Andrew Ng – Machine Learning, Coursera

Paid with placement help: Great Learning AI/ML Program (mygreatlearning.com
)

Hands-on practice: Kaggle Courses

⚡ Goal: Build your first ML models and understand how AI works.

Step 3: Specialize & Build Real Projects (3–4 months)

Now, you start focusing on AI developer skills:

🔹 What to do:

Deep Learning (CNNs for images, RNNs for sequences)

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Generative AI (optional, if you want to work with models like GPT)

Build real projects: chatbot, recommendation system, image classifier

🔹 Recommended resources:

Udacity Nanodegree – AI Programming with Python (project-focused, mentorship)

Intellipaat – AI Developer Program (live projects + placement assistance)

fast.ai Deep Learning Course
 (free, highly practical)

⚡ Goal: Have 2–3 projects in your portfolio — these are key for interviews.
