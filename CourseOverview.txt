Other things I need to learn
----------------------------
Deep Learning frameworks
    PyTorch or TensorFlow are industry standards for AI/ML.
Mathematics for AI
    Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics are essential to understand how models work.
Model deployment skills
    Knowing how to put AI models into production using Flask, FastAPI, or cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Advanced machine learning / AI
    Neural networks, NLP (natural language processing), computer vision, reinforcement learning depending on your target role.
Projects / Portfolio
    Recruiters care more about what you’ve built than just libraries you know. Real projects show practical skills.
